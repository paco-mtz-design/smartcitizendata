# [Smart Citizen Data Experiment](http://raidho.mx/saturdaycoding/smart/)

I'm using this project to teach my team about APIs during a series of Javascript workshops I'm conducting with them. I own a Smart Citizen arduino, and I thought it would be nice to fetch its data via their API, and then display cool information about our Design Studio on our webpage.

Here's the basic output: <http://raidho.mx/saturdaycoding/smart/>, we'll keep playing around with it on future workshops.

Check out <https://smartcitizen.me/devices/view/673> for more information on Smart Citizen and my profile there.

## About this small exercise

We used [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) for the boilerplate markup, and the JSON information retrieved from the [Smart Citizen's API](http://api.smartcitizen.me/) along with pretty simple jQuery methods to parse the JSON object.
