# [Smart Citizen Data Experiment](http://raidho.mx/saturdaycoding/smart/)

I'm using this project to practice while I learn Javascript. I own a Smart Citizen arduino, and I thought it would be nice to fetch its data via their API, and then display cool information about my studio on my webpage.

Check out <https://smartcitizen.me/devices/view/673> for more information on Smart Citizen and my profile there.

## About this small exercise

I'm using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) for the boilerplate markup, and the JSON information retrieved from the [Smart Citizen's API](http://api.smartcitizen.me/) along with pretty simple jQuery methods to parse the JSON object.
